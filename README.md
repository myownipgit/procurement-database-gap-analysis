## 🎯 Project Overview

This project delivers a comprehensive gap analysis of an existing procurement database against 17 strategic C-Suite reports, providing a detailed roadmap to transform basic spend analytics into a fully automated executive reporting platform.

### **Current State**
- **Database**: SQLite with 4 tables, 72k transactions, $509.9M spend (2009-2018)
- **Vendors**: 2,716 suppliers with basic performance metrics
- **Categories**: 6,569 commodities with strategic classification
- **Report Coverage**: 5-60% automation across 17 executive reports

### **Target State**
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with 35+ tables, comprehensive business modules
- **Reports**: 100% automated generation for all 17 C-Suite reports
- **Performance**: Sub-2 second query response times
- **Integration**: Real-time data feeds from ERP, SRM, and risk systems

### **3. Implementation Roadmap**
18-month phased approach with resource planning:
- **Phase 1** (6 months): Foundation + High-Impact Modules
- **Phase 2** (6 months): Process Excellence + Compliance
- **Phase 3** (6 months): Strategic Intelligence + Analytics

### **4. Cross-Report Data Model**
Unified architecture enabling:
- Single source of truth for master data

SELECT 
    v.vendor_name,
    v.vendor_tier,
    fsa.delivery_performance_score,
    SUM(fsa.spend_amount) as total_spend
FROM fact_spend_analytics fsa
JOIN dim_vendors v ON fsa.vendor_key = v.vendor_key
WHERE v.vendor_tier = 'Strategic'
GROUP BY v.vendor_key, v.vendor_name, v.vendor_tier, fsa.delivery_performance_score;
```
